<h1>Neural Diode Clipper</h1>


<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This repository is about the use of neural networks for simulating diode pairs inside a WDF. We introduce a training circuit for diode pair that allows us to transform data from Kirchhoff domain into wave domain. Several diode clipper circuits were modeled to evaluate the performance of trained neural networks. Our results suggest that even small neural nets can get high modeling accuracy compared to SPICE simulation. These experiments demonstrate neural nets is a promising way to model nonlinear behavior inside WDF. (For more details, check out the report)</p>


<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>We have prepared a few pre-trained networks for use in Neutone, just download the plugin from https://neutone.space/ with any daws on any platform. Then click 'Load your own' and select the downloaded network file.</p>


<h2>Train your own network</h2>

This repository contains the files while implementing the neural diode clipper
mentioned in the paper 'EFFICIENT METHOD FOR TRAINING NEURAL DIODE PAIRS FOR WAVE DIGITAL
FILTERS'. The project is well-recorded with jupyter notebook, along with some trained models and a plugin.
